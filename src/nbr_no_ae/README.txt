This folder contains source codes that replicate the results in Section 3.
-- The three python files are the data generation script, the training script, and the query-answering script.
-- "samples1.txt" and "samples2.txt" are generated by "generate_data.py". "nbr.pickle" is generated by "train.py". They are included here so that one does not have to go through all steps, and can pick and choose which step to run.

The following is the full procedure. As mentioned, one may skip steps because of the side files included.

1. ./generate_data.py
   This command will overwrite "samples1.txt" and "samples2.txt". These two files contain partial observations which are the training data.

2. ./train.py
   This command will overwrite "nbr.pickle" with a new model that is trained from scratch based on "samples1.txt" and "samples2.txt".

3. ./query.py
   This command loads the model from "nbr.pickle" and answers five queries. The displayed results match the content of Table 1.
   One can easily try other queries by modifying the last five lines of this script.
