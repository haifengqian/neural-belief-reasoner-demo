# Neural Belief Reasoner Demo

This repo contains training and inference code and model checkpoint that reproduce experimental results in the following paper.

"[Neural belief reasoner](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2020/0590.pdf)," Haifeng Qian, *Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)*, pp. 4275-4282, 2020.

For Section 3 which is a demonstration of neural belief reasoner on an unsupervised-learning task, follow instructions in `src/nbr_with_ae/README.txt` and `src/nbr_no_ae/README.txt`.

For Section 4 which is a supervised-learning task, inference code is provided in `src/nbr_mnist_4_9/inference.py`.
